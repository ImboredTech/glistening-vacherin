              <h2>How we do it.</h2>
              <p>Well, some schools blocking systems are really sifisticated. And lets say my schools is, you would use the common method of websockets. But my school and some other schools block websockets.</p>
              <p>Then you could say well you could use embeds, and yes they could be used but they can be really laggy and some schools have better blocking systems than others so that might get blocked as well.</p>
              <p>So that only leaves one reliable option. Strip the game of its code and add it to a different file.</p>

              <h2>How schools wont block this website.</h2> 
              <p>Now you could say the school would just block the website. Well no.</p>
              <p>This website will use tempory domains and will always be changing. So they cant block the domains.</p>
              <p>All domain updates will be posted on our twitter and our discord server.</p>

                <p>Little dislamer. Games like 1v1.lol and krunker.io (are just examples they are some more) won't be able to be played. This is due to me not having the tools to strip the code.</p>
                <h2>Why did i do it.</h2>
                <p>Well i am a student myself in a secondary school. (yes im British)</p>
                <p>And congrats to the school that im in if they find me. (and no you can't check domain records they get destroyed after the domain change)</p>
                <p>Anyway most people would get bored in lessons so why not give them something fun to do.</p>
